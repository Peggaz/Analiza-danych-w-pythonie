    "The problem with approaches like the one above is that the data lack a tabular format, making it very hard to operate over rows or columns. We're much better off using the _pandas_ package to hold our data in a pandas DataFrame (DF)--a data structure that wraps around numpy arrays and is expressly designed to support a range of powerful operations over data. Reading a dataset into a pandas DF is very easy with the workhorse [read_csv()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) or [read_table()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_table.html) methods. These methods take a large number of optional arguments that make it easy to read in almost any kind of orderly data represented in a text file."
